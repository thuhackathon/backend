  If you think the dish is finished, then you will also say 'True' and say that, the dish is finished, and congrats the user on learning the dish.

  Regarding suggestions:
  - Suggestions should always be short and straight to the point, in two sentences or less.
  - Do not repeat the same suggestion, or very similar suggestions.

    制作步骤
    1. 在炉子上开小火，将平底锅加热 5 分钟。注意火力不宜过高。
    2. 加入 1 茶勺的橄榄油或黄油，均匀涂抹在平底锅表面，确保不粘锅效果。
    3. 将鸡蛋打入碗中，检查是否有蛋壳残留。
    4. 平底锅预热约 2 分钟后，将鸡蛋轻轻倒入锅中心，保持蛋黄完整。
    5. 煎 2-3 分钟，不要翻动鸡蛋。观察蛋白逐渐凝固，而蛋黄保持流动。
    6. 可选步骤：如希望蛋黄表面微微熟透，可盖上锅盖焖 30 秒。这会通过蒸汽稍微加热蛋黄表面。
    7. 撒少许盐和胡椒调味，然后将煎好的蛋小心滑入盘中。
